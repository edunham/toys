FILES!!

cite.py is the machine that makes citations magically happen... in theory.
	it should probably hold the citations themselves once they get added in.

// demo.py was for testing cite.py. it's currently unused.

mech.py is the mechanics of the robot's logic. You hand it a big bundle of 
	nice specific triggers, and it magics them into coherent conversational
	submission. 

// obj_backup.py was apparently from before i did something that i thought might 
	break obj.py. i don't think it's useful at the moment, but better
	safe than sorry...

obj.py is holds Obj, the objection parent class with all the getters and 
	logic-ful loveliness that keeps me from having to poke around inside 
	the individual objection objects when i want their details. it also 
	has each of the specific objection classes, which aren't reeeeally 
	necessary but it's easier to jam all the static conversation bits into 
	a side file than mess with tweaking a bunch of Obj objects in main

// robot.py is the old complete-robot, known-good at the phase when the only working
	objection was God_Obj, and probably broken if i've tweaked anything useful
	in obj.py. Citations not implemented. Unless snarky.py immolates himself
	the hour before we're turning this thing in, ignore robot.

snarky.py... yay! yells at mech and makes there be a robot, then pokes and prods 
	at various objections. as of this writing, the triggers passed to mech.py 
	are hard-coded in this file rather than over there. Makes them more 
	transparent-like.
