# ics

Generates random calendar entries to tell you to talk to your friends. 
Because that's apparently something I need. 

## Usage

`./myics.py --help`

You can offer multiple recipients. For instance:

`./myics.py -r Garnet -r Amethyst -r Pearl`

## Future ideas

* Improve the encouragements list -- perhaps break it out to a file?
* Include https://www.randomlists.com/emojis because it's cute
* Option of "remind once per interval" (day, month) for minimum reminder density
