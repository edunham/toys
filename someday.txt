average linkedin engineer -- take a data set of a bunch of engineers with the
same job title on linkedin. of those with a mugshot type photo, average or
composite the faces into a generic face. name is the most common 1st letter of
each unique first name, then 2nd, and so on. job titles and descriptions come
from a word-sized markov chain on the samples'. perhaps numbers get swapped
for an average of all numbers in the set which appeared to have the same
units? Company names might come from a character-wise markov chain on unique
company names in the data set. then publish the recruiter emails it gets on a
blog.

config management challenges -- they have these for security and programming,
why not configs? types:

    * serverspec test that you have to make pass
    * semi-working puppet/chef/salt/ansible config that you have to fix
    * VM with running service, config must run first time without taking it
      down (hard mode)
    * competition mode where you point it at a github repo and a throwaway
      host, possibly sandstorm.io, runs and tests the configs from the repo

deploy https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh for dotfiles repo


Software to Build or Find
=========================

Screenshot Screen Lock
----------------------

Screen lock keyboard shortcut to lock all connected monitors and use a
screenshot of what was on them at the time of the shortcut instead of a
regular lockscreen.

Useful for confs where first slide of talk is up on the projector but you want
to walk away.

Typo
----

Fuzzer to introduce common typographical errors into code. Find what's common
from playground?


what do
-------

like the easy issue aggregators, but for arbitrarily harder issues. should
work across repos+orgs, search for all of an assignee, all unassigned, or all
of a given tag per repo or per org

sysdiff
-------

Ansible-flavored tool to compare two systems to which one has SSH access.
Several layers:

* Hardware. What're the diffs between processor, amount of ram, amount of
  disk, etc.?
* OS & Packages: what's the package manager say is installed? What do language
  -specific managers say they have installed? What versions are they? What
  version of Linux? Vanilla, or patched?
* Filesystem/packages: Maybe piggyback on cleverness of rsync or similar? It'd
  be nice to detect "A has buildbot installed at X and B has buildbot
  installed at Y but they're the same Buildbot"

sysgrep
-------

"do I have a database installed?" even if it's not configured right or on the
path

sysstat
-------

maybe prereq to sysdiff -- "please tell me all the stuff I have installed and
its versions". Might be doable through package manager, though I'd like to
include all executables outside the homedir to account for manual
installations of stuff. Print the output in a standardized way and it's half
of sysdiff.

sysstat

Calagator Schedulator
---------------------

* Automatically pull recurring events from meetup.com into calagator
* Gather words-description of event (first thursday, third wednesday, etc.)
  and suggest unoccupoied such times

ASL-To-Text
-----------

https://code.google.com/p/pp-usc-ss12-sign-language-reader/ has been dead
sinced 2010. Will it still work?

Station
-------

"chatops" through a security-optimized chat server. Adapters to IRC, Slack,
Hipchat (how hard is it to have a single channel that exposes itself as all 3
protocols?) for chat channels. Adapters to whatever identity source of truth
(LDAP). Optimize for simplicity of plugging in infrastructure-touching tools
-- monitoring, CM, etc.

human simulator
---------------

free, open-source, combine the allure of the sims and civ and stuff but with
an easily scriptable api. possibly build Python-flavored scripting right into
it?

interaction perhaps via either a df-ish ascii thing or IRC interaction. Could
be basis for a chatbot that can actually follow a conversation... might just
turn into good mud AI though.

image attribution simplifier
----------------------------

you give it a wikimedia url, it wget's the picture into the current directory
and appends the appropriate credit information to credits.txt


Distributed collaboration platform
----------------------------------

crowd-source finishing the starwars asciimation (towel.blinkenlights.nl) with
frames submitted by PR and verified by code review. automate code review
process of comparing gif of frames to submitted ascii. this is a nobler cause
than "emoji dick", and it managed to happen...

Command-Line Image Tools
------------------------

meme message: A command-line wrapper for `git commit` that would take an image
URL, convert the image to ASCII art, and stick it at the end of the long-form
commit message. Alternately, pre-ascii-ify the top n memes and permit `git
commit -m <memename>`

Train Computers to Train People
-------------------------------

apply psych principles (conditioning, spaced repetition, whatever else) to UI
so computer can train person to accomplish goals
    prereqs:
        goals (quantified etc.)
        willingness to write UI stuff
        test subjects

    Personal gamification. The device of reward-for-action then timeout before
    next time the action can trigger a reward, as well as rewards at fixed
    sums of cumulative points, seems powerful. The trick is accurately
    calibrating those cooldown periods to correspond to real life.

    also, time tracking. but easy. this might already exist.

Internet of New Things
----------------------

*new internet*: automatically hide all links to anything it knows you've seen
before -- gracefully skip repeated images by repeating whatever action got you
the new one (rightarrow), gray out URLs, count how often a URL is linked from
things you browse. Visualize net of the internet pages one actually visits,
and net of "potential interests" that're often linked from things you go to
but haven't been clicked yet.


Bobcat Box of Books
-------------------

kinda like http://www.bobcatinabox.com/ but $5/month and
send books it thinks you'll like, or which complete your collection, or w/e
    prereqs:
        home library catalog type sw
        db of similarities between books -- Dewey + Amazon ratings??
        willingness (or painlessness) to actually catalog all existing books
            -- maybe catalog input by ISBN and prints a QR to stick on the
            spine so a photo of the shelf can tell you what's on it via OCR?
        more space to store books
            -- maybe include a thing for automatically auctioning disliked or
            irrelevant books from collection, to fund the habit of acquiring
            more?

Book Robot
----------
Point a webcam at a wall of bookshelves. And maybe a projector. Use image
recognition to tell you where each book is. Bonus points for spotlighting it.

madlibs etherpad
----------------

like a regular etherpad, but with 2 sides -- one where you write the skeleton,
and one where you fill in the blanks.

issue categorizer
-----------------

examine a github issue tracker and find bugs with certain traits:

* widely noticed -- n* the usual # of unique commenters
* echo chamber / note to self -- comments only from 1 person
* flapping -- often closed and reopened

A similar thing in progress is at https://github.com/servo/servo-starters

Comic Rocket Batches
--------------------

It would be nice to have a feature where comic rocket only bumps a strip into
your "things to read" section at the end of a book or chapter -- some comics
are just better in large doses


Speech-and-stuff To Text
------------------------

a) Command IoT devices using short whistled melodies or rhythms of claps.
Easier to recognize offline(?). Blinkenlights to signal what it thinks it's
hearing as feedback.

b) Why do we not use whistles/snaps/claps/clicks as meta keys when voice
typing? Is there a framework to handle that already?

Game Mechanics
==============

out-of-commission
-----------------

universally fixed difficulty of world. Player starts with crazy OP avatar, so
the tasks are easy. Leveling up removes the avatar's strength/skills/whatever,
thus making world harder and require greater player skill / creativity to get
around in. Could analogize to human aging or to mars rover.


Phone Apps
==========

Easier Access to Gamification Data
----------------------------------

because i don't obsess over the thing enough, i want *an android widget of my
github contributions calendar*. update every time i'm on wifi; use cached
version the rest of the time.

Creepines for a Good Cause
--------------------------

time management stuff that uses phone debug data dump (screen on times, etc,
like shown on battery history) to make better picture of how time is spent
    prereqs:
        clearer goal
        willingness to touch Android


Hardware to Build
=================

rimshot
-------

make one of the little iot computers listen to the noise levels in a room.
when there's silence followed by that "ohhhh" that you say when someone said
something that deserves a rimshot... it should hit a tiny drum twice then hit
a tiny cymbal.

Also maybe stick a cricket leg in for lulls? can cricket legs still chirp when
they're dried out?

Testing the Limits of Facial Recognition
----------------------------------------

figure out natural-ish makeup to fool security cameras
    prereqs:
        samples of face recognition software
        makeup
        volunteers?

http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/

Charging More
-------------

Investigate whether it's possible to charge a phone via a headphone jack if
the volume is loud, such as in the armrest of an older plane without outlets.

candy sorting robot
-------------------

sort small candies, including jelly beans, by color using opencv and some
servos.

stilly straw
------------

A crazy straw with a heating/cooling element, so that your sippable food item
would have its temperature corrected on demand.


Posts or other docs to write
============================

Everything one needs to know to work on $PROJECT offline

How a modern "devops" stack goes together and where all the buzzwords fit
    ("Which tool should I use?" type starter)

Everything Else
===============

make personal site cool like about page of http://maryrosecook.com/

Eco-friendly hipster lightbulbs
--------------------------------

So there's those lightbulbs with the glowy filament inside that look super
pretty, but waste a bunch of power and get super hot, right? Well what if
instead of basically making tiny fire you actually hid an LED in the base and
the fillament was a highly lossy fibre optic cable so it'd glow evenly?

Non-euclidean ruffles
----------------------

It would be super neat to instead of gathering fabric to get a frill, piece a
bunch of shapes that don't tesselate flat or only tesselate on non-euclidean
surfaces (kind of like that geometry through crochet book except actually
predictable and wearable because woven fabric)

decibel visualizer
------------------

cute desk toy that lights up brighter when the environment is louder


vanity domains
--------------

put in a precise nick and it finds for each 2 or 3-char substring whether a)
that's a TLD, b) the stuff before it is available as a domain.

falling off the internet
------------------------

of own browsing/download history, find what's NOT on archive.org

combine  http://domaininferno.com/ and archive.org to find the content that
has lost its names

The former might be solved by
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/archiveror/


reed->read->red
---------------

i want a thing to track stuff i ought to read eventually. it ought not tell
others, except perhaps publishing summaries/reviews. ought to save a URL of a
post, or download a PDF, or track paper-books, with equal (hopefully lack of)
difficulty.

could(should)? be command line. might be awkward to enter paperbook data; json
perhaps?

    get: command that records a paperbook title or article topic to encourage
        finding it later

    reed: command that adds a specific instance of something i have access to
        and ought to read, but haven't time right away.

    read: command that gives me something to read, when i have time but not
        ideas.

    red: some kind of action, summary or review, to take upon having
        successfully read a thing.

oh also, sorting between topics/hats would be rather nice. dev, ops, psych,
philosophy, robots, meta, news, etc. possibly also handle time constraints?

this might be implement-able as a Taskwarrior plugin. perhaps a 'read' in
/usr/bin that'd swap out the current task in i3bar??

music generated from the environment
------------------------------------

listening to the mirror's edge soundtrack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05wiQQbFLU at the recommendtation of
http://imgur.com/gallery/fULGO thinking about how ambient, electronic music
could be used as a 6th sense, of sorts, to monitor IoT devices' state. when
something's working correctly it sings along with the house; when off it's
quiet; when something is going wrong with it, it gets discordant.

could be a gentler reminder of time-sensitive tasks by gradually transitioning
into the times when actions need to be taken, reducing the amount of interrupt
-- for instance, what if the microwave crescendo'd and accelerando'd and then
quit when the food was done, rather than just humm and then beep? the parents'
washing machine plays a little tune when the wash is done rather than
screeching like the drier does, and although it's less unpleasant, it's also
really confusing when random music starts out of nowhere.

background tempo, pitch, and beats should probably be environmental
temperature, presence/absence in room, electricity usage, etc.

end goal is to hack greater connectedness with environment via enjoyable,
non-interruptey, subconscious musical cues.

same thing could potentially be done with systems monitoring -- chunk each
time segment of traffic into a beat, give a rhythm pattern to each service
being monitored, volume is the load on that particular server. i hypothesize
that this would leverage auditory pattern recognition to earlier detect
errors, in the same way that graphs leverage visual pattern recognition. maybe
i'm just a '90s kid but i still vividly recall the tone pattern of the modem
dialing our ISP back in the day, and could tell from any deviations in the
pattern whether it was connecting successfully or not... and that was like
half my life ago. also, stick in a particular melody or "hook" for debug
tracing?

possible collaboration between houses, as well -- refrigerator could put its
chill cycle after fitbit says you're asleep; appliances could do their
white-noise thing to mask it when the neighbors are being loud.

extra brain
-----------

do a full arch install on a 64GB USB stick. possibly rsync my ssd onto it
weekly.

something for tracking all these damn projects
-----------------------------------------------

vague ideas, status, idea groups, in-progresses, research.

netsplatter
-----------

it is hard to see what's going on with Freenode netsplits.

Get a list of all Freenode server names.

Connect one bot per server and put them all in a room together. Expose
netsplit data based on who can see whom.

my etherpads
------------

keep track of all the etherpads I've spent time on in this browser profile.
Offer a list of them, grouped by name similarity... or even searchable list
based on substrings of the name. oh, & dates used.

could be implemented with a magic cookie in etherpad sw itself, or as a
browser extension.


Solved Problems
===============

Git Auto-Track
--------------

Script to update master to match origin/master in all git repos in a directory
if possible, and list those where it's impossible

The tool is called repo

https://source.android.com/source/developing.html

The thing I actually wanted was

http://myrepos.branchable.com/
